This is a standalone directory structure for getting a single page application set up with basic reset styles and jQuery + rjs.

This is duplicated from the rest of the repository. I didn't want the repository to have to reflect site folder structure, but I also wanted a starting template that worked out of the box. Maybe a better way is to have a batch file generate a startup project from the repository.
